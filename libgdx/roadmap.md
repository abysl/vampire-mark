### **MVP Benchmark Demo Roadmap**

---

#### **1. Milestone: ECS Integrations**

- [x] **1.1.** Set up basic project structure for each ECS (Artemis, Fleks, Dominion).
- [x] **1.2.** Define common components (Position, Velocity, Texture, etc.) for each ECS.
- [ ] **1.3.** Create entity factories or methods for easy entity creation in each ECS.

---

#### **2. Milestone: Basic Gameplay Mechanics**

- [x] **2.1.** Implement player character movement using keyboard inputs.
- [ ] **2.2.** Set up basic enemy spawning mechanism.
- [ ] **2.3.** Implement simple collision detection between player and enemies.
- [ ] **2.4.** Create a scoring system based on time survived or enemies avoided.

---

#### **3. Milestone: Graphics and Sound**

- [x] **3.1.** Integrate the renderer with each ECS setup.
- [x] **3.2.** Develop or source a set of basic sprites for player, enemies, and power-ups.
- [ ] **3.3.** Implement background music and basic sound effects.

---

#### **4. Milestone: Procedural Background Generation**

- [ ] **4.1.** Design a simple algorithm for infinite procedural generation of the background/tilemap.
- [ ] **4.2.** Implement and integrate the procedural generation into the game renderer.
- [ ] **4.3.** Ensure the generated backgrounds are varied and have a logical flow.

---

#### **5. Milestone: Benchmarking Framework**

- [ ] **5.1.** Develop a mechanism to spawn entities continuously and monitor performance.
- [ ] **5.2.** Implement the damage calculation stress test.
- [ ] **5.3.** Design the rendering stress test.
- [ ] **5.4.** Create a UI to display benchmark results.

---

#### **6. Milestone: Optimization**
