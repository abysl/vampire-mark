# Project Introduction

This project is a venture into game development using Kotlin, employing libraries such as LibGDX, LibKTX, and Artemis-ODB to create a rich and interactive gaming experience. The game operates on a grid-based world where each tile represents a unit of space, and entities interact within this world. This document serves as a starting point to understand the various subsystems involved in the project.

## Subsystems Index

1. **Spatial Configuration**
    - Understanding the grid-based system.
    - Configuring tile and chunk sizes.

2. **Coordinate System**
    - Introduction to TileCoord, GameCoord, and ChunkCoord.
    - Converting between coordinate systems.

3. **Tile System**
    - Understanding Tiles and their properties.
    - Introduction to TileSet and TileStack.

4. **Tile Map System**
    - Understanding the TileMap Interface.
    - ChunkedTileMap Implementation.

5. **Entity-Component-System (ECS)**
    - Introduction to Artemis-ODB.
    - Understanding Components, Entities, and Systems.

6. **Rendering System**
    - Basic concepts of rendering in LibGDX.
    - Implementing rendering systems within ECS.

7. **Procedural Generation**
    - Generating game world chunks.
    - Implementing procedural generation algorithms.

8. **Asset Management**
    - Loading and managing game assets.
    - Understanding AssetStorage and its configurations.

9. **Physics System**
    - Basics of collision detection and response.
    - Implementing physics systems within ECS.

10. **Input Handling**
    - Capturing and processing player input.
    - Implementing input systems within ECS.

11. **Audio System**
    - Managing game audio.
    - Implementing audio systems within ECS.

12. **Debugging and Profiling**
    - Tools and techniques for debugging.
    - Performance profiling and optimizations.

Each subsystem introduces fundamental concepts and builds upon the previous ones, providing a structured learning path. As you progress through the subsystems, you'll gain a deeper understanding of the project architecture and the technologies employed in game development.
