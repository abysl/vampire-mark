### **MVP Benchmark Demo Roadmap**

---

#### **1. Milestone: ECS Integrations**

- [x] **1.1.** Set up basic project structure for each ECS (Artemis, Fleks, Dominion).
- [x] **1.2.** Define common components (Position, Velocity, Texture, etc.) for each ECS.
- [x] **1.3.** Create entity factories or methods for easy entity creation in each ECS.

---

#### **2. Milestone: Procedural Background and World Design**

- [ ] **2.1.** Design a simple algorithm for infinite procedural generation of the background/tilemap.
- [ ] **2.2.** Implement and integrate the procedural generation into the game renderer.
- [ ] **2.3.** Ensure the generated backgrounds are varied and have a logical flow.
- [ ] **2.4.** Implement basic tile collision.
- [ ] **2.5.** Develop an event system to handle different tile types (damage tiles, status tiles, etc.).

---

#### **3. Milestone: Basic Gameplay Mechanics**

- [x] **3.1.** Implement player character movement using keyboard inputs.
- [ ] **3.2.** Set up basic enemy spawning mechanism.
- [ ] **3.3.** Implement advanced collision detection (with enemies, special tiles, etc.).
- [ ] **3.4.** Create a scoring system based on time survived or enemies avoided.

---

#### **4. Milestone: Graphics and Sound**

- [x] **4.1.** Integrate the renderer with each ECS setup.
- [x] **4.2.** Develop or source a set of basic sprites for player, enemies, and power-ups.
- [ ] **4.3.** Implement background music and basic sound effects.

---

#### **5. Milestone: UI and Settings**

- [ ] **5.1.** Implement a UI system.
- [ ] **5.2.** Create a settings menu.
- [ ] **5.3.** Add an in-game overlay to display stats and statistics (toggle with F3).

---

#### **6. Milestone: Benchmarking Framework**

- [ ] **6.1.** Develop a mechanism to spawn entities continuously and monitor performance.
- [ ] **6.2.** Implement the damage calculation stress test.
- [ ] **6.3.** Design the rendering stress test.
- [ ] **6.4.** Create a UI to display benchmark results.

---

#### **7. Milestone: Optimization**

- [ ] **7.1.** Profile each ECS setup.
- [ ] **7.2.** Refactor or optimize based on profiling.
- [ ] **7.3.** Adjust the renderer or other bottlenecks.

---

#### **8. Milestone: Documentation and Release**

- [ ] **8.1.** Document the project setup and benchmarking.
- [ ] **8.2.** Package the demo for release.
- [ ] **8.3.** Publish the demo and results on GitHub.

---

#### **9. Milestone: Community Engagement**

- [ ] **9.1.** Gather feedback.
- [ ] **9.2.** Address any reported bugs.
- [ ] **9.3.** Extend the demo based on feedback.
